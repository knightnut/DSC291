    "The goal is to use the variable WT08 analyzing if there is a relationship between COVID-19 and US air quality in 2020.According to our plan, the experimental design is as follows: \n",

    "1. Extract daily values of variables over January - April of all years to the present worldwide.\n",
11
    "2. Quantify historic variability in each variable at a site-by-site level: e.g., mean and CI (parametric or non-parametric quantile intervals) by site over all years to 2019. This might depend on data scarcity/availability.\n",
12
    "3. Evaluate placement of 2020 observations relative to long-term variability using appropriate statistical test.\n",
13
    "4. Potential use of PCA: across all sites (not site by site), could look and see if components responsible for greatest variation in 2020 data look different than prior years (not sure if that’s possible - might be for precip and temp, prob not for smoke/haze and fog)\n"
